    2) Calculate parking time based on payment;
    3) Know earning, parking time bought;
    4) Issue receipts;
    5) Handle buy and cancel events.

    The interface also acts as a Facade of the pay station
    domain handling system with regards to the graphical
    user interface / hardware side of the station.
